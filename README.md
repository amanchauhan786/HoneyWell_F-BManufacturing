# HoneyWell_F-BManufacturing
Predictive Quality Control for F&B Manufacturing
A Brewery Case Study for the Honeywell Campus Connect Hackathon
This project is an end-to-end machine learning system designed to predict quality anomalies in a brewery's manufacturing process in real-time. It uses a Random Forest model to provide an actionable Quality Alert and is demonstrated through a fully interactive web dashboard built with Streamlit.

üìã Project Overview
This project tackles the critical challenge of maintaining consistent product quality in the Food & Beverage industry. By analyzing in-process sensor data, our system can identify potential quality issues before a batch is finished, allowing for proactive intervention.

Key Features:
Data-Driven Anomaly Detection: Classifies each production batch as either "Normal" or "Anomaly" based on its process parameters.

Model Bake-Off: A comparative analysis was conducted between four models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) to select the best performer.

Explainable AI (XAI): Uses SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain why the model made a specific prediction, turning it from a "black box" into a practical decision-support tool.

Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly web interface to explore predictions and understand the underlying data.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Language: Python

Data Analysis & Modeling: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE), XGBoost, LightGBM

Explainability: SHAP

Dashboard & Deployment: Streamlit, ngrok

Development Environment: Google Colab, PyCharm / VS Code

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/amanchauhan786/HoneyWell_F-BManufacturing.git
cd HoneyWell_F-BManufacturing


Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`


Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt


‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Dashboard
Once the setup is complete, you can launch the Streamlit dashboard from your terminal:

streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py


Your web browser will open a new tab with the interactive application.
